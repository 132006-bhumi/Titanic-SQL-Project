This project focuses on analyzing the Titanic passenger dataset using SQL. The goal is to derive insights into survival patterns based on various factors like gender, class, age, and embarkation point, by writing structured queries on a relational database.
# 🔍 Project Summary
The Titanic dataset is a classic in data analytics, containing details about passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, which tragically sank in 1912. This project uses SQL to explore and extract meaningful insights from the dataset stored in a relational database, answering key questions about survival trends and demographic distributions.
# 🎯 What This Project Covers
This SQL-based analysis includes:

• Importing and structuring Titanic data into SQL tables.

• Writing queries to analyze survival rates by:

• Gender

• Passenger class

• Age groups

• Port of embarkation

• Identifying missing or null data using SQL functions.

• Using GROUP BY, ORDER BY, CASE, JOIN, and aggregate functions to uncover trends.

• Answering real-world analytical questions through SQL-only methods.
# 💡 Key Insights
• Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males.

• First-class passengers were more likely to survive compared to those in second and third class.

• Children (age < 10) had higher survival chances than older adults.

• The embarkation point 'C' (Cherbourg) had a relatively higher survival rate.

• Many records had missing age or cabin information, which was identified using IS NULL
