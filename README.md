This project focuses on analyzing the Titanic passenger dataset using SQL. The goal is to derive insights into survival patterns based on various factors like gender, class, age, and embarkation point, by writing structured queries on a relational database.
# üîç Project Summary
The Titanic dataset is a classic in data analytics, containing details about passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, which tragically sank in 1912. This project uses SQL to explore and extract meaningful insights from the dataset stored in a relational database, answering key questions about survival trends and demographic distributions.
# üéØ What This Project Covers
This SQL-based analysis includes:

‚Ä¢ Importing and structuring Titanic data into SQL tables.

‚Ä¢ Writing queries to analyze survival rates by:

‚Ä¢ Gender

‚Ä¢ Passenger class

‚Ä¢ Age groups

‚Ä¢ Port of embarkation

‚Ä¢ Identifying missing or null data using SQL functions.

‚Ä¢ Using GROUP BY, ORDER BY, CASE, JOIN, and aggregate functions to uncover trends.

‚Ä¢ Answering real-world analytical questions through SQL-only methods.
# ‚ùì Key Questions Explored
‚ú¶ How many passengers were onboard the Titanic?

‚ú¶ How many passengers survived?

‚ú¶ What is the survival rate by gender?

‚ú¶ How many passengers embarked from each port?

‚ú¶ Who are the youngest and oldest passengers who survived?

‚ú¶ Which ticket had the highest fare, and who was the passenger?

‚ú¶ Find the survival rate of passengers who were alone vs. with family.

‚ú¶ Which cabin prefix (e.g., 'C', 'D', etc.) had the highest survival rate?
# üí° Key Insights
‚Ä¢ Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males.

‚Ä¢ First-class passengers were more likely to survive compared to those in second and third class.

‚Ä¢ Children (age < 10) had higher survival chances than older adults.

‚Ä¢ The embarkation point 'C' (Cherbourg) had a relatively higher survival rate.
# üìå Final Thoughts
This project helped me strengthen my SQL querying skills by working with a structured real-world dataset. It highlights how powerful SQL can be in uncovering trends, identifying anomalies, and answering business-relevant questions directly from the database without external tools. This project can be expanded by connecting SQL output to visualization tools like Power BI, Tableau, or Python libraries for richer dashboards and reports.
